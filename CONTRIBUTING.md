# Contributing to App::GitGot

We appreciate your desire to contribute to GitGot.

Please note, App::GitGot is stable, mature software that many people
depend on for their day-to-day workflows. Any contribution needs to
either fix an outstanding bug, or to add a useful new feature to the
project. In particular, changes that are "lateral upgrades" of
dependencies are unlikely to be accepted. Changes that alter existing
interfaces will _NOT_ be accepted.

The ideal workflow is to open a new issue proposing your feature, or
describing the bug you'd like to fix, along with a rough outline of
how you propose to implement your change. Doing that prior to starting
to code will likely save time and frustration for all.
